## Hi, I'm Espi. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web and software developer that mostly makes JavaScript/TypeScript apps.

## About Me
I develop projects and libraries that I find interesting or I'll use. I also contribute to various projects, but not all of them are located here. Outside of code, I like to chill in various communities, play games, and listen to music.

## Current Projects
- [Hibiki][Hibiki] - My general-purpose Discord bot. Written for Node.js and is currently my most succesful project.
- [Bulmaselect][Bulmaselect] - A multiselect library for the web written in vanilla JavaScript.

## Contact
The quickest way to contact me is usually my Telegram. I'm also on Discord @ espi#0001.
