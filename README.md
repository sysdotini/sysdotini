## Hi, I'm Espi. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web and software developer that mostly works with JavaScript and TypeScript.

## About
I develop projects and libraries that I find interesting or I'll use. I also contribute to various projects, but not all of them are located here.

Outside of code, I like to spend time tinkering with various hardware and software and posting about my findings and interests to my [Twitter][Twitter].

## Projects
I don't have all of my projects listed, but here's a brief overview of some stuff I've done. Hopefully this list grows in time.
- [Hibiki][Hibiki] - My Discord bot; proudly used in over 1000 guilds.
- [Bulmaselect][Bulmaselect] - A fast Vanilla JavaScript multiselect library for the web.

## Contact
The quickest way to contact me is usually my Telegram. I'm also `espi#0001` on Discord.
